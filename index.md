### The Name

The word _emulsion_ in general refers to a substance in which two or more non-soluble liquids are mixed together so that the molecules are finely dispersed. For example mayonnaise is an emulsion of oil, egg yolk, and some acidic ingredient like vinegar or lemon juice.

Here emulsion refers to _photographic emulsion_ which is a substance that among other things can be used to develop images from.

In this sense emulsion is a thin layer that displays an image.

This description suits the program just as well. Emulsion is a thin layer between the operating system and the user as it is one single executable file accompanied by a few UI elements adding up to a size under 5 MBs.
