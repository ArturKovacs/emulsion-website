# Similar Programs

To help you find the software that you need, here's a comparison with other, similar image viewers.
Neither of the following software can play an animation from an image file sequence so I left
that out from the comparison tables.

## qView

## Image Glass

[Website](https://imageglass.org/)

Image Glass is a feature-rich image viewer. It can do so many things which Emulsion cannot, that it
would be pointless to try to list all those things. All-in-all, if you are using Windows, you'll
most probably find Image Glass more appropriate to use.
