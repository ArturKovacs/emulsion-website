# Similar Programs

To help you find the software that you need, here's a comparison with other, similar image viewers.
Neither of the following software can play an animation from an image file sequence so I left that
out from the comparisons.

## qView 4.0

[Website](https://interversehq.com/qview/)

Has a graphical configuration window with a bit more customization options. Has a somewhat different
behaviour with image scaling and window resizing. Transparency blends into the background unlike
in Emulsion where a checkerbboard pattern is used.

## Image Glass 7.6.4

[Website](https://imageglass.org/)

For Windows only. It has a lot more features than Emulsion but can be configured to show no UI
elements other than the image. Unlike Emulsion it cannot open files which lack a file-name
extension. All-in-all, if you are using Windows, you'll probably find Image Glass more appropriate
to use.

## feh 2.23

[Website](https://feh.finalrewind.org/)

For Linux only. It can do a number of things which Emulsaion cannot, notably it can rotate and flip
images. However the transparency pattern covers the entire window (by default) instead of only the
image area as in Emulsion. It also has a ton of configuration and command line options.

## sxiv 26

[Website](https://github.com/muennich/sxiv)

For Linux only. Can display a preview of all images within a folder and has significantly different
defaults input behaviour.

## Eye Of Gnome

[Website](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/EyeOfGnome)

For Linux only. Can rotate image, display their EXIF metadata, can set an image as the wallpaper,
and has the option to open images with another program.
