# Similar Programs

To help you find the software that you need, here's a comparison with other, similar image viewers.
Neither of the following software can play an animation from an image file sequence so I left
that out from the comparison tables.

## Image Glass

https://imageglass.org/

Image Glass is a feature-rich image viewer. It can do so many things which Emulsion cannot, that it
would be pointless to try to list all those things. All-in-all, if you are using Windows, you'll
most probably find Image Glass more appropriate to use.

| Image Glass 7.6.4.30                            | Emulsion 7.2                                   |
|-------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Feature-rich (see note above)                   | Limited feature set                            |
| Background color can be chosen                  | Background is either dark or light             |
| Only for Windows                                | For Windows and Linux (partial macOS support)  |
